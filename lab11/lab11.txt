Question 1: Describe the errors that occur when trying to assemble lab11.asm. Identify the cause of each error.

 14: illegal operands for missing opcode - no .ORIG in the first line, just memory location
 16: instruction appears before .ORIG - no .ORIG appearing in the code, no starting position
 17: constant outside of allowed range - uses new PC value instead of decimal number for increment
 19: illegal operands for ADD - extra comma
 30: constant outside of allowed range - uses new PC value instead of decimal number for increment
 32: label OUTERLOOP has already appeared - switch pz to zp
 35: constant outside of allowed range - uses new PC value instead of decimal number for increment
 43: no .END directive found - no defined end

Question 2: For each label in the code, write down the corresponding memory location. 
	
	OUTERLOOP: x3004
	INNERLOOP: x3005
	INPUT: x300E

Question 3: Between using labels and explicit memory locations/offsets, which one makes the most sense, and why?
	
	Labels make the most sense in this context because it's way easier to understand labels and there is no need to concern yourself with offsets and adding more lines of code because of them/changing numbers each time.
